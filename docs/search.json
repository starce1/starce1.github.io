The only two districts that ended up winning democrat are 2 and 3 which won by a lot since they are darker blues. There is evidence of gerrymandering in this map since some republican districts (especially 1, 7, and 8) were intentionally made to barely win republican so the state could come out that way overall."

Lets see what the map of those looks like!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we gain from these maps is some information about tornadoes by state. The first map shows that they seem to happen just about everywhere, but since Texas is the biggest state it has by far the most. When putting into consideration whether tornadoes are violent or not we get a better idea of where bad tornadoes happen as well as the frequency of them."
