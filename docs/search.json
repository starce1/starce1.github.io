    "text": "This map represents the proportion of people who voted for republican candidates in 2016 in each Wisconsin district. The only three districts that ended up winning democrat are 2, 3, and 4 which won by a lot since they are darker blues. There is evidence of gerrymandering in this map since all republican winning districts were intentionally made to barely win republican (which is seen in this map by the extremely slight tints of red for republican winning districts) so the state could come out winning republican overall. The gerrymandering was especially bad where districts 3 and 4 were so lopsided for democrats that they were such large blowouts that no republican candidates even ran since many democrats were intentionally lumped into these districts by the republicans that drew them so they could gain an advantage."

Lets see what the map of those looks like!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we gain from these maps is some information about tornadoes by state. The first map shows that they seem to happen just about everywhere, but since Texas is the biggest state it has by far the most. When putting into consideration whether tornadoes are violent or not we get a better idea of where bad tornadoes happen as well as the frequency of them."
